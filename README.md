Please note that this plugin has not been planned to be maintained. It is for my South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) AT3 Individual Digital Solution.

Please also note the following:
- This plugin should be run on Java 21.
- This plugin is not guaranteed to work on other versions of Java, and will not be tested to run on this version.
- This plugin has only been tested to work on PaperMC 1.21, and will most likely break on Spigot due to its use of the Adventure API.
